# National Parks API
Simple API using MongoDB, NodeJS and Express. Features a fuzzy search to autocomplete list of all National Parks. Delivers photo, information about the park, state it's located in, and the number of visitors last year.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express

I wanted to create a project using an auto-complete search that querried a database after each keystroke. I also love the National Parks system so I decided to make that the focus of this project. 

## Optimizations
I would like to update this so every park has it's own dynamically generated page instead of simply changing the background image for accessability reasons. 

## Lessons Learned:
Learning how much Express helps NodeJS and streamlines the coding process. The auto-complete was much more difficult to figure out than I thought it might be but I would like to take another shot at it in a future project.
